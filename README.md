# PacMan DFS Maze Solver

This project implements a Pac-Man agent to find paths through a maze world using the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The goal is to find a path to a specific location within the maze and display intermediate solutions as well as the final path.

## How it Works

- Two Python files: The main file calls functions from a secondary file containing essential functions.
- DFS Algorithm: The Pac-Man agent uses the DFS algorithm to explore the maze, prioritizing deep paths before backtracking.
- Maze Creation: The "pyMaze" file creates the Pac-Man maze using a library.
- Intermediate Solutions: The program generates intermediate solutions, showing Pac-Man's progress.
- Final Path: Once the goal is reached, the program displays the optimal path taken by Pac-Man.

## Running the Program

1. Install Python 3.0 (64 bit).

2. Download the project files from the repository.

3. Execute `main.py` using the command: `python main.py`.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to view intermediate solutions and the final path.
